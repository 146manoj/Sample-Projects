Most of the time I just forget to use them consistently, so I can't really see whether they work or don't. At least with this shampoo and conditioner, I use it on a daily basis, and my hair does look (somewhat fuller). No, it's not a miracle cure, there isn't new hair, but I think the hair I have is probably thicker. And it's about the same price as any other shampoo without having all those chemicals and emulsifiers in it. So, seems pretty good to me.",5.0 out of 5 stars,14-Sep-15,DGC80,"Deeply nourish and hydrate fine, thinning hair with Avalon Organics Biotin B-Complex Thickening Conditioner.

I decided for the price it was worth a gamble and I after a few weeks I am very happy I gave it a shot.  The shampoo has a strong wake up fragrance and on a Monday at 6:00 in the morning we all could use a little help waking up.  For lathering it does a very good job and my hair feels clean and great.  I use the conditioner daily and I feel that it has helped not only with strenth of my hair but also adds to the control I am actually using less product now in my hair because my hair will stay put and I am no longer trying to keep it tame on windy days.  Not really any drawbacks on either right now and if you are thining a little or want to boost your hairs strength I would say give it shot. I notice that there is not hair in the sink in the mornings anymore and I contribute it to the shampoo and conditioner.

My fault, I was a newbie to the reviewer world and I failed to realize the importance of tried and true testing. 160 reviews later I get it. It took 3 different products and a very specific combination of products to achieve the texture that I was looking for.Me - 28 this month. V shaped hairline. Hairstyle - long enough to run a comb through, usually let it grow for 1.5 months then cut back.The Biotin B-Complex conditioner is a daily counterbalance to the Biotin Shampoo. The Shampoo is harsh but effective. It leaves my hair feeling like a brillo pad and the conditioner helps break that apart. When used together the signs of balding are significantly reduced (seeing your scalp through the hair). Also, my hairstyle is a lot easier and fuller looking (messy and pushed up in the front).Even with the combination I found my hair needing a break from the two. I use Organix Coconut milk conditioner once a week to soften my hair. This is an extremely effective break.The proportions I use suit my taste. The appearance of thickness is all I really care about. I know i'll go bald eventually which is why i'm putting the work in the gym now.

I have now been using the combination of Biotin B shampoo and conditioner for about 2 months now.  I would also like to explain a little bit about my hair - I have medium shoulder length, straight hair.  I have very oily skin, which then gets my hair oily by the end of the day.  My scalp also gets very itchy, something I have attributed to an allergy in the ""chemical"" shampoos (I formerly used Artec by Loreal professional, Joico, and Matrix).  I also swim in a chlorinated pool on a fairly regular basis.Pros: organic - need I say more? gentle - I takes away my itch, and I have not had any other problems with dandruff or anything. The first ingredient listed is Aloe.So/So: smell  - not super yummy, but not intolerable eitherCons: Tangles!!!  No matter how much I use, the conditioner does not detangle my hair.  I let my hair dry, almost completely before I comb it (sometimes that's hard)  Oil fields.  For some reason, this conditioner really makes my hair oily.  Before I even get out of the shower, my hair is so gluey, oily, and just not even nice.  I let it just dry that way, to see if it's only appearing oily while it's wet; nope.  It weighed down my hair, and it just wasn't as flowy and light.  To help, (I really wanted to give the combination a good go) I began not completely rinsing the shampoo out of my hair prior to adding the conditioner.  I would then completely rinse the shampoo and conditioner simultaneously.  This did alleviate a good chunk of the oil, but my hair still felt weighed down.Quantity to condition.  In order to get the conditioner to completely get to all of my hair, I had to use a ton!  It is really thick, and hard to spread throughout my hair.  I ended up running out of conditioner at the time that my shampoo was half empty.As far as ""thickening"" goes, I have noticed with using the combination of shampoo + conditioner, that my hair is not necessarily thicker, however, I have noticed that as I wash/condition my hair, less hair falls out during the showering process.  I used to have so much hair in the drain after a shower that my boyfriend used to joke, ""how are you not bald by now?!?"", but now I only loose maybe 7 or so hairs in the shower.  A MAJOR decrease.  With less hair falling out, I would certainly say that my hair is able to ""thicken"", not on an individual strand level, but overall my head of hair is thicker.Would I purchase again - yes/no.  I would purchase the shampoo again (I overall liked the way it cleaned, and made my scalp feel), but I would probably not purchase the conditioner again.  I suppose I will continue on the hunt for the perfect shampoo/conditioner combo.",3.0 out of 5 stars,26-May-12,K.

Good improvement!,"So i have been using the Avalon Organics both Shampoo and Conditioner for a few months now. I have seen a pretty good result. My hair has definitely gotten a bit thicker and stronger. I notice less hair falling out. I have combined this shampoo/conditioner with also taking Biotin Supplements so i do not know if its solely because of the shampoo/conditioner or a combination between the both, but improvement is there. My only one complain is that the conditioner doesnt give you that soft conditioner feel other conditioners give you.. Its a little rough as oppose to soft. In conclusion, if you have thin hair i recommend both products as well to supplement with a daily Biotin vitamin.",4.0 out of 5 stars,25-May-12,isthisvick,"Deeply nourish and hydrate fine, thinning hair with Avalon Organics Biotin B-Complex Thickening Conditioner.

I can't really speak to its claim of thicker hair because in all fairness, I've only used it for a few weeks. And in all fairness, I did not read through the entire list of ingredients. With that being said, one of the ingredients is dimethicone, which may or may not clog pores. I'm currently suffering from major hair fall out and have been looking for shampoos and conditioners without dimethicone and other questionable ingredients. So when I saw dimethicone, I immediately avoided using it on my scalp and just apply it on the hair only. It doesn't really do much for my hair but I accidentally found out that it works great if you leave it in your hair as a leave-in to obtain effortless beachy waves. Also, the conditioner is super thick, making it very difficult to dispense--so difficult that it hurts my hand to force it out of the bottle. Overall, I will not be repurchasing this for three reasons: 1) difficult to dispense, 2) has dimethicone, 3) does absolutely nothing else for my hair other than give me waves if used as a leave-in. As for the shampoo, I'm going to test it out a few more weeks. The shampoo does not contain dimethicone though.",4.0 out of 5 stars,24-Aug-16,phea,"Deeply nourish and hydrate fine, thinning hair with Avalon Organics Biotin B-Complex Thickening Conditioner.

I only really use this on my roots because I didn't find it particularly moisturizing on the length and ends of my long hair (past mid back) and I think that it is better suited to a scalp application anyways because it's purpose is hair growth- why waste it on the length and ends? When I did use it on my whole head it did not distribute very well and did pretty much nothing for the manageability of my hair.",4.0 out of 5 stars,21-Dec-15,Ashley Brooke,"Deeply nourish and hydrate fine, thinning hair with Avalon Organics Biotin B-Complex Thickening Conditioner.

The smell is very similar to lemon Pledge or Lysol. When I first opened the conditioner, it was really a really thick and creamy appearance, but the second I put it in my hair, it lost all of its integrity and seemingly barely covered my hair! I usually start applying at my tips and slowly working my way up to about 4"" away from my roots, but I was having such a hard time working it up that I had to reapply a couple times. What a waste of conditioner! When I rinsed it out, my hair had a dry and straw-ish consistency. Not very pleased. I do notice that my hair has grown a bit faster this past month or two. I'm unsure if that's due to the Biotin supplements or the shampoo/conditioner. I just end up throwing a bunch of Dove brand leave-in conditioner because of the way this shamp/cond leaves my hair.",2.0 out of 5 stars,20-Feb-13,zeekaye,"Deeply nourish and hydrate fine, thinning hair with Avalon Organics Biotin B-Complex Thickening Conditioner.

See detailed review.,"6/8/2013, first review: I thought to review this product as time goes on. I've only been using it for a week, so I do not expect to see hair growth at this point.  It's good to note that I'm 42 years old, w/disturbing hair loss.The bottles are SMALL so I'm not using it carelessly. The smell is not flowery & fun, but it's more medicinal in scent, not overpowering. The shampoo lathers if you work at it, & it's a low lather rather than a high and luffy one. I rub it gently on my scalp & throughout my hair. If scrub too hard, I'll lose MORE HAIR. :( I am washing my hair every day, where I used to wash every other day. The conditioner does not lather.  It's more of a cream that I rub gently onto wet hair. My hair feels sort of weighty as I wash it & I think that I'm going to have a BAD HAIR DAY ahead of me, but after styling, it's actually soft, manageable, not weighty! After washing, I wrap in a towel for about 5 minutes, apply FINESSE styling mousse, let my brown curls air dry. Sometimes a touch of hairspray but most days, not. With the thick feel in the shower, I am surprised that it's not weighted down after styling. SO, I'll keep on trying this for 3 months. I'll try to remember to update if I see a difference. Feel free to ask me questions.**IT'S IMPORTANT TO MENTION THAT ALONG W/THE SHAMPOO & CONDITIONER, I'M TAKING, MAXI HAIR SUPPLEMENTS.  My Dr. was pleased w/the ingredients of the shamp, cond AND supplements. I use the supplements in place of a multi so I also take OMEGA 3 & Calcium Citrate w/ D3. (As per Dr).**6/27/2013 - Although there is NO new hair growth, I've noticed that I'M LOSING LESS HAIR when I wash & style!  It's enough for me to notice & enough for me to keep going w/ this trial. 19 days in, w/ consistent use of shamp/cond & Maxi Hair, my hair is smoother, softer, shinier stronger, doesn't have a bad smell, still not weighty & continues to be manageable. I feel like whatever residue was clogging my hair is out. My hope is that this is the case for my scalp & maybe, just maybe, I'll see some new sprouts. A girl can dream. :)6/30/2013 - Could it be?  New hair?  Will keep you posted.  I see three short hairs poking through!  I should also note that my nails need to be trimmed more often than ever, and I have to shave, (legs, underarms), more frequently!  I suspect this would be from the internal good I'm getting from the Maxi-Hair supplement.7/21/2013 - YES!  Still losing less hair, AND there IS new hair growth in little stray spots.  My nails, which I keep short, need to be cut once every week to 10 days as opposed to once every 3 or more weeks!  I rcvd two complements on my hair this past week, about how shiny &healthy it looks!  I remain faithful to the products, using them EVERY DAY as recommended.9/21/13 - IMPORTANT UPDATE.  It seems that with months of use, this product is GREAT for clearing up any residue on my scalp, BUT it is drying out my hair.  I have to rotate my use of this and the conditioner.  It's stripping the oils from my hair.  I will still use the shampoo and conditioner, but may just use it once a week.  WIll keep updating.  I did notice that for the past two weeks, when I use the products, my scalp gets just a little itchy.  That also indicates to me that the residue blocking my pores may be cleared up!  That is the good part!  SO, I will be using the MAXI HAIR daily as bottle recommends, but will limit the use of the shampoo and conditioner.",4.0 out of 5 stars,8-Jun-13,Kristina Montes,"Deeply nourish and hydrate fine, thinning hair with Avalon Organics Biotin B-Complex Thickening Conditioner.

My hair has been coming out a bit before this but I was completely surprised when using it the first time, SO MUCH of my hair came out in the shower & when I was coming it out afterward that I started crying!!!  I skipped washing my hair for one day and then used it again just to see if I was imaginging it.  Well I wasn't because it happened again.  I went to Ulta and purchased some Nioxin which I've used before and washed my hair with it this morning.  Only a little bit of my hair came out...and by little bit, I mean more than the average person but WAY less than when I used the Biotin B-Complex.  Im glad it works for some people and hope it works for you.  I tried it due to all of the positive reviews and although I hardly ever review anything, I felt so strongly about my experience that I had to share it. I am sending this product back today!

I thought I would warn future buyers of a few negative aspects I personally experienced.1. I believe this shampoo was watered down at some point. Through experience, a shampoo is most effective when it can build up a good lather and foam up nicely. It takes 2 full tablespoons to get that result with this product. I don't believe that's normal.2. The shampoo is quite drying and makes my hair feel like straw. All my short whisps reach for the sky. (Even with the same brand conditioner). This is what I'm trying to avoid!I suspect different hair types will react differently, so here's the makeup of mine: My hair isn't thick or thin. It takes to curling quickly and has natural waves if I let it air dry. I've colored it on and off for 20 years but in the last 6 months or so I've gone natural - no hair products with harsh chemicals; I went no-poo for a short while.

Having said that, I ordered this conditioner because it promises to thicken the hair shaft naturally; however, when I applied it through my hair, it did little if anything to de-tangle. It reminds me of body lotion and it might as well have been. I had to use my regular conditioner to de-tangle. I pulled more hair out trying to work this stuff through my hair.

The conditioner has a quite an extensive list of natural oils and ingredients. I can say for sure that the stimulating scalp part does work because I can feel a slight tingling in my scalp just after I use it. I believe this is for stimulating blood flow to the scalp. It does nourish my hair without leaving it feeling too greasy when it dries out.There isn't a strong scent to this conditioner, but it does have a slight earthy or bark-like aromatic smell as you're applying it. As you can tell from the picture the consistency is very similar to hand lotion.I'm mostly pleased by the ingredients for a natural way to thicken hair growth without using the toxic ingredients in other brands at the grocery store.

Over years of flat iron and hair dye abuse, my hair had become stringy and limp and thin. I have been taking oral Biotin vitamins for many years now and was very happy with the results. When I saw this product I was stoked because I could nourish my hair from the inside and out now. I read the reviews about the smell and thought it was a small price to pay for thick healthy hair. I bought the conditioner instead of the shampoo because I figured I could mix this conditioner with my other smell-good conditioner and get the benefits with a better smell. I was right. If you buy this conditioner and mix it with another conditioner (I use a replenishing Redken one), you can get the best of both worlds, awesome softness and smell, with thicker healthier hair. The conditioner has saw palmetto in it which I assume is why the conditioner smells a little like a plant. After only a couple of uses I have noticed a lot less hair falling out in my hands and my hair is fuller and feels stronger.

Usually with organic shampoos and conditioners you have to cake on the shampoo and conditioners, not these.  When first using the conditioner it may seem as if you need to use more than normal, but give it some work first.  Use what you would normally use, and gently work it around the ends of your hair, really rubbing it all around, then move your way up, you should have plenty.  Then let it sit for a few minutes before rinsing (I shampoo my hair first thing, put the conditioner in, then wash my face and body, shave, then rinse the conditioner out lightly).  My hair is so soft, styles well, no frizz, and feels so good! I will never change shampoo/conditioners again!(See my review for the shampoo under the same headline).",5.0 out of 5 stars,8-Aug-14,Brooke,"Deeply nourish and hydrate fine, thinning hair with Avalon Organics Biotin B-Complex Thickening Conditioner.

I have done plenty of research on all the chemicals we put into our bodies on a daily basis. Based on reviews I tried this as well as John Masters and a few others. First thing I noticed was a medicine type smell. I didn't notice any difference in the volume and it seem to leave a slight residue in my hair. I am a shampoo junkie and have tried just about everything that is out there. I think that John Masters and Derm Organics have much better products that do not contain harmful chemicals. Also Bumble & Bumble has a great thickening shampoo and conditioner however they do contain a few extras in the ingredients but not to the extent of many that are on the market today.

""Fullness"" is caused by stripping oils and making hair fluffy","I was so very disappointed with my purchase of the Avalon Thickening shampoo and conditioner. I had such high hopes, but in only two shampooings, my hair was noticeably stripped of oils, had that ""squeaky clean"" feeling you get when using a very harsh product, and it became dry and brittle. It started looking very dull. They use many products that have an oil stripping effect on the hair, like orange oil and lemon oil. You might think because it says, 'oil' that it might add to your hair's shine, but these are ingredients in industrial strength degreasers. This product only damaged my hair. Avalon is only 70% organic and it had a rather unpleasant smell to me. Rather like mosquito repellant or dish soap. Using a harsh product like this is very detrimental for your hair. I know that a lot of people will be drawn to Avalon because of the low price, but if it drastically stripped my extremely oily hair in two shampoos, I can't imagine what it might do to yours. Although my hair is very fine, so perhaps ethnic girls, and women with coarser hair might benefit? I honestly wouldn't recommend it. I'd rather see people get something that will improve their self-esteem immediately, rather than give them new problems to worry about.In desperation I purchased the more expensive Just Naturals system for thinning hair and believe me, it blows Avalon out of the water. In just one shampoo my hair regained it's texture and became so silky it felt like Asian hair. I can't stop touching my hair now and I feel so much more confident. They use incredible ingredients that greatly benefit people with hair loss due to hormonal issues, or who have an increase in DHT. You do pay more than double for that shampoo, but having something that supports your hair, improves the texture, and smells fantastic, was worth it to me. I'm now quite confident in what I'm using and plan to go on using it, regardless of the cost. I'd pay 5x what I'm paying for it now, I love it so much. And their treatment spray is oil based. I use the system twice a day and I'm shocked at how long it is lasting. It has truly been an excellent investment.I would recommend that you shampoo and condition your hair twice a day if you want to see regrowth with any system. This is because one application of shampoo with DHT-fighting ingredients, can only do so much. Your body is constantly generating new hormones and new DHT. By helping to combat it twice a day, you have a better chance of seeing results sooner. This is coming from a 36 year old woman who has been fighting repeated hair loss due to hormonal imbalance from 16 on. Once a day just never cut it for me. Using a leave on treatment like Just Naturals has overnight, can also work wonders. I use it during the day too if I'm not going out.I hope this helps you recover your hair, and your self-esteem, a little faster and more efficiently. :o)",2.0 out of 5 stars,4-Jun-14,VirtualGrace,"Deeply nourish and hydrate fine, thinning hair with Avalon Organics Biotin B-Complex Thickening Conditioner.

I had ordered several bottles because this used to be my ""conditioner for life"". When I opened the first one and squeezed a little conditioner onto my hand, I thought, oh no, this is not conditioner! I ended up putting it in my hair anyway, and I was terrified. My hair was a sticky, tangly mess, like I had put glue in my hair and really rubbed it in. I opened another bottle, thought, maybe something was wrong with the first one. Same thing. I had send all of it back. They were nice about the return though.

I have hair to my pants that I wash every 2-3 days (I don't get it colored), and it has always been pretty manageable. I need about double the amount of product that I needed with other conditioners and my hair is left feeling stripped once I rinse it. My hair is so hard to brush after using this conditioner - I have HUGE ratty tangles and have to empty my brush of loose (or ripped out) hair about every time I wash it (I have been using it for a month to see if it would get better as my hair got used to it, but no such luck). When brushing, I can hear my hair ripping and I have more frizz and split ends than I did when I was highlighting my hair every 2 months! The shampoo that pairs with this I started using this week to see if it would be better, and it is actually worse. I LOVE their lotions and face care products, but their B-complex hair products are a bust. :(",1.0 out of 5 stars,15-Aug-16,Stephanie Stenger,"Deeply nourish and hydrate fine, thinning hair with Avalon Organics Biotin B-Complex Thickening Conditioner.

This conditioner is horrible. I've tried it several times just to make sure that it's not a case of my hair needing to adjust. It hardly detangles my hair after shampooing at all. Leaves a greasy, rough film behind, and makes my hair feel coarse, stiff, and weirdly not-even-washed when dry. Worst of all, my hair is so tangled and matted after I wash it that I have to brush it, and I lose all my curls. I am kicking myself for buying a giant bottle of this without ever trying it.

I have been using it for about 6 months and have not seen any hair-loss prevention or any hair growth what so ever. It is very reasonably priced and does leave my hair feeling thicker and better looking than other shampoos i've tried. I do think it promotes your hair to produce more oils though, it is pretty potent. After about 12-14 hours my forehead and scalp seem more oily than in the past since using this product, but nothing terrible or alarming.The smell could be better. It doesn't necessarily smell bad, but it kinda smells like lemony dish soap or like dial hand soap--like some commercial bathroom product--But you gotta hand it to them, it smells pretty damn good for a product having Saw Palmetto berries in it--in case you were unaware, saw palmetto extract and berries smell like pure vomit and death...lol! Don't worry you can't smell the saw palmetto at all. It is not strong scented, you'll just have a light fragrance of some industrial lemon-like handsoap while washing your hair.For the price, it's definitely worth it to at least try.",3.0 out of 5 stars,1-Feb-11,S.
