I have semi-oily skin that gets very dry after washing, which creates more oil over the course of the day, and then sets in this vicious cycle where I can't find a happy medium. After using this creme in the morning after a shower, my skin stays balanced. Moisturized, but not greasy. Now my skin tends to get less oily throughout the day. The creme itself feels very smooth and mild, and doesn't have a scent, which is a must for me. I also picked up some small cosmetic spatulas to scoop out the creme so that I'm not dipping my fingers into the jar every time. I feel like with some of this skincare stuff it's hard to tell if it's doing anything beneficial, but I really could tell the difference with the Jason creme.

This came recommended from some sites after a search for vegan, cruelty-free, and in general something with as few chemicals as possible.I use it on my face, chin and chest, but what prompted me to write this review was what it did for a healing BURN on my arm.About a week ago I burned the underside of my arm (you know, the pale part that shows scares easily). The scab is almost gone, but the rest was still bright. It looked like a bright pink comet on my arm. Last night it was VERY itchy and driving me crazy!! I had enough so instead of using neosporin like I usually do, I reached for this. It's been less than 12 hours and the redness was reduced by 50-60%!!!!!!!!!!!I am BLOWN AWAY.

Lichem Plantis.  The thing that worked for me the best was a skin brush to relieve itch, a cold cloth, or soak in cold water, and then put this vitamon E cream on.  Now I also mix it with a bit of tumeric in a half empty jar of the e cream.  I have one that is plain for wearing in the day and one half filled with the cream and tumeric at night.  The tumeric cream turns your skin orange, so that's for night.  During the day the regular.  It works for me. I'm just sharing this cause Linchen Plantis is a disease straight from Hell if you ask me and I want someone to find some relief.  The expensive creams which I don't think I'm allowed to name, well I sent them back.  Over $50 and did nothing even thou they advertise it's for Linchem Plantis, it did  not help me, in fact made it itch more.  A couple did that.  One day at the Health food store I saw the vitamon E for $10, and thought well it can't hurt.  It has helped.  Not totally but a lot.  Pray to Jesus and receive His healing.  And wait.  If you have faith it will come if you stand on scripture.  If you don't have faith, well it won't come.  In the mean time, till my healing comes forth, this is how I deal with the itch.  Its helped me a lot.  I can enjoy things again and my nights are not so bad now.

Better to use at night. Have only been using for about a week, so I don't know if there's a long-term benefit.  I do apply to other parts of my body with sun damaged skin, and am hoping to see an improvement. Will update after a while, if I remember to do so. Being a natural product, it seems there's no scent added, so it's not particularly pleasant in that regard, but not terribly offensive. It would be nice if something was added, like a few drops of essential oil, to improve that aspect of the product.  Some people have commented that the smell was really bad, so I'm wondering if the seller did not properly store it and it became rancid, which is possible, I would think, because it probably lacks preservatives, being a natural produce.  I bought it because of the high content of Vitamin E, but I probably won't purchase again, unless I see noticeable improvement of the skin.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2019","Teresa G","JASON Age Renewal Vitamin E 25,000 IU Moisturizing Crème delivers deep, long-lasting hydration to help minimize the visible signs of skin aging.

Boy was I wrong.  This works great!","As a night time stuffiness sufferer, I have tried breathe right strips, saline sprays, OTC allergy meds like Flonase, and other natural dry nose products with no real benefit.  While Benzedrex inhaler does help, it has some nasty chemicals from what I've read and I had wanted to find something safer.  After a week with Olbas I can definitively say it works great.  It is not a cure, but it does offer relief by opening my nasal passage by my unscientific estimate of 25% and has an immediate effect.  By comparison, breathe right strips claim to open passages up by as much as 38% (not for me), but those didn't do much for me and left a red line across my nose all day long after wearing at night.  I feel I have slept better after a couple sniffs of Olbas and while it does not always last all night, I fall asleep more easily and sleep more deeply for most of the night.  On a couple occasions I did wake up in the morning still breathing clearly so my hope is that the effects may be cumulative or that possibly some healing is taking place that may continue to improve my breathing.  I am generally skeptical of claims about the effectiveness of ""natural"" products but I have found this product lives up to the hype.  I strongly recommend this product for safe, temporary relief of mild to moderate sinus restriction (congestion/inflammation).  Not for small children, read the label.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2016","E. Heinrich","Natural Olbas vapors provide a pleasant, refreshing, and cooling sensation to your nasal passages.

Apparently, if your monthlies return while you are still breastfeeding it can cause your milk supply to temporarily drop. Fenugreek (at least for me and many others) prevents the drop from happening.

It caused him to have issues with gas which made him very fussy, and his BMs became very watery. Even though I only took one day’s worth, it took several days to get it out of my system.

I was in search of something sandalwood scented and stumbled on Shikai (the sandalwood scented one is also amazing!).  I got it, was very impressed, then Spring started and I wanted something brighter.  The Yuzu is a bright citrus scent, somewhere between grapefruit and lemon, hard to really describe.  The scent is very mild, which is perfect for me.  I'm super sensitive to smells, coupled with migraines makes it really difficult to find anything that has the right level of scent.  Most of my friends and family also suffer from migraines so they also appreciate the mildness.  The other great part about this bodywash is how great it feels on my skin.  I have fairly sensitive skin, some body washes have given me chemical burns in the past.  I have yet to go wrong with an oatmeal based product.  The office I work in is very dry, that little bit of added defense from the oatmeal and aloe makes my time there much less itchy.It does seem a bit on the expensive side, but it only requires a little bit (quarter sized) on a sea sponge to wash my whole body and I still have to finish rinsing the soap out.  So it lasts a long time.  I love this product!  If you're on the fence, just try it, if nothing else, we all know someone with sensitive skin and I'm sure they'll appreciate the lack of added colors and mild scent.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2017","Tara G","Sold Individually.

Then I quit taking it for a year because I was in the menopause transition and whenever I used it I began having periods again.  Must have been the influence of the SOY.  I suspect soy isoflavones in concentration.  My cholesterol actually did go up after I quit using it but my numbers improved on the ratios.  Go figure!  When I learned how this was chemically processed I gave it up for good and threw the last one in the trash.  I have to say my blood sugar began to go up though when I quit it so had to do some real diet reprocessing.

Its use in folk remedies dates back centuries, and people have long believed it to provide health benefits of various sorts.Well, thanks to modern science, some of these claims are actually being verified in proper studies. Initial results show a whole lot of potential for garlic as a natural and safe way to improve cholesterol levels and treat hypertension. Even though it's unlikely that all of garlic's claimed healing properties will be verified, it's already looking like it does more good than harm on the cardiovascular front, and that's enough for me to dive in.There's a catch, though; not all garlic supplements are created equal. It's got to be tempting to grab one of those garlic oil based products which is much cheaper per ""equivalent"" garlic does, but don't be fooled: they don't seem to provide all of the same health benefits. Short of using fresh garlic (which you can and should do sometimes for taste, if nothing else!) aged garlic extract is the next best thing. Don't settle for less!Kyolic makes a dizzying array of subtly different garlic products, but this one is by all appearances the best. Aged garlic extract? Check. No other weird additives? Check. Proper dosage? Check. Although it looks expensive, very few (if any) other products on the market give you as high a dose of the good stuff for as low a price. Look carefully and although they may be cheaper, they're dishing out ""equivalent"" doses or lower doses, requiring you to take multiple pills to reach the efficacy of this product.So, dear reader, buy with confidence.

I've had terrible sinus and allergy problems for years that cause me to have symptoms that mimic asthma. When the seasons change or when there are barometric changes (i.e.: rain), I wheeze and cough terribly. When this happens, I can't sleep because I'm coughing all night. I've taken very low-dose steroids, but after long-term use I think their effectiveness starts to wear off sooner (and who wants to be on steroids forever). I ordered this product because this is a perfect time to try it - April/May, when the pollen is high and it rains a lot. After just one week, I could feel a difference in my breathing. I don't feel 100% ""cured"", but it's still working after two weeks and there's enough of an improvement that I rated this product five stars. I'm not coughing and wheezing at night or during the day. The product is an all-natural blend of plants contained in a vegetable/cellulose/silica capsule. I've ordered more bottles of Clear Lungs and I'm going to continue using this product. I'll update my review if anything changes, but I'm no longer skeptical.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2017","reegee","ClearLungs is a unique blend of Chinese herbs that helps maintain clear breathing, keep airways open and mucus levels normal.","ClearLungs is a unique blend of chinese herbs that helps maintain free breathing"

I use it everyday and I have used it in replacement of over the counter allergy medicines. I have had taken S-Barr a very aweful autoimmune and since battling with that auto immune sickness I had to apply knowledge of herbs supplements and a lot of research in order to maintain not getting sicker. In my case the S Barr was very bad. Which affected my breathing my ability to fight off infections. Increased my allergens etc. This will work for most yet don't just read what I am writing or think it is a fake write up read other reviews go online and take a look. You will see that this product has been around and clearly has helped many with multitudes of disorders. My advice is if you are purchasing this because you wish to use it as a preventive; stack it with Epicor. If you are not suffering from auto immune using both of these along with a healthy diet and lifestyle. You probably will not get sick. I am serious.

I have heavy, strong asthma attack in the middle of my sleep, not everyday but depends on the whether. As I just begin to lay down I feel the heavy congestion in my lungs starting to wheeze. Literally every time when this happens I honestly feel scared to sleep because I always feel that, is thinking my last sleep? Will I wake up again? Is there anything that can help me breathe like a normal person?? I felt scared, and didn't know what to do. During and after the asthma/allergies attack takes at least 4-5 hours until 70% back to breathing. Until I realized maybe my lungs are weak and sensitive, and so I should find a supplement to support my lungs before they worsen up in the future. Then yes I have found this and since the day I started taking this supplement my fears during sleep is gone and my asthma attack hasn't come back yet.

I agree with reviews that say that less than 9 drops to a cup (of coffee or tea) is just right and more drops may impart that bitter stevia taste. The dropper makes it easy to add just the right amount. It does need to be refrigerated and I don't find that to be a problem. I'm guessing that taking it with me for a few hours will not be a problem, but SweetLeaf also makes a powder in one-serving packets that I also use. This is a company that has received over 21 awards for taste and innovation (according to their web site) and has high quality standards.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2016","Julie A.","Natural Sweet Leaf Sweet Drops have zero calories, zero carbs and are gluten-free.

Had a funky aftertaste, and I vowed never to set my mouth on it again. However, after reading some of the reviews here, I decided to give it another shot - particularly now that Splenda is off my ""OK"" list, and agave is even questionable.I am thrilled to report that, like the other reviewers, I can discern NO weird aftertaste! I use this product in coffee and tea (3 drops), oatmeal (4 drops) and many other items. It's super, duper sweet, so only a few drops are necessary. This translates to about 600+ ""servings"" (according to the label), which means this bottle will last a LONG time!So glad to have found this item!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2011","Koa","Natural Sweet Leaf Sweet Drops have zero calories, zero carbs and are gluten-free.

However, I was used to putting this on my face and this just won't do.  The feel of it after I applied it to my hands was nice though, it's not greasy at all, which it's rare to find a cream that isn't greasy.

First, I really didn’t mind the maple syrup smell. I actually liked that smell better than my BO, and it seemed like I was sweating less in general. Sweet! Now come almost a week later (of taking 2 pills twice a day), my baby hadn’t really pooped much, and when he did he started having diarrhea a couple times a day. After the 2nd day of the loose stools I looked up feugreek side effects and diarrhea in the baby is one of them. Immediately stopped taking the pills but took another week for it to be out of my system. This whole time my supply hadn’t changed, and I also had loose stool in my baby to worry about.

This is a very hydrating toner packed with healing aloe vera that not only refreshes but moisturizes the skin and cleans out dirty pores. I even mix this toner with some almond oil to use as a makeup remover! Very safe, very natural (you can also find it at Sprout's grocery store) and perfect pre-primer toner for a day out.

Everytime I lay down to go to sleep the rattling was incredibly bad and resulted in chronic coughing. I could not stop it.

I've tried various brands, but the Lewis Labs granules are my favorite.  Only 1 time in many years one of the cans did not have as good a quality (not consistent granule size, more powdery, not as tasty).It seems to me that it does have a helpful effect on the brain.  Of course that is extremely subjective and I cannot quantify it, but whenever I haven't used lecithin for a while, I notice a difference.New comment: the past three cans have been more powder than granules, disappointing but still better tasting than the other brands.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2013","UpQuarkMom","The lecithin from Lewis labs is like no other lecithin in the world.

The pros are that it contains excellent ingredients that are well-cared for, organic, it's gluten-free, dairy-free, and also contains probiotics.  The cons are that it tastes/smells like fish food to me (and I've read things about citric acid compromising the integrity of the ingredients so I only mix with water, cold green tea, or apple juice), it doesn't mix well with only a spoon (i needed a milk frother), and even when thoroughly-mixed it can still have a grainy/sandy texture I wasn't a fan of (but one that plagued most of the green drinks I've tried).  The other thing that bothered me was the way the spoon was packaged in there... it has such a long stem that they have to put it in upside-down with the scoop end facing up, which means until you lessen the level of progreens in the container, you're touching the scoop and the scoop handle for awhile (and accidentally getting little bits spilled on the counter in the process).  Once I had less in the container I just cut the spoon in half and now it rest spoon-side down, so I no longer have to touch and possibly contaminate the part of the spoon that touches the product.  Maybe that's not a big deal to anyone else, but it was a little peeve of mine.The best product I've tried so far is actually local to me (Pittsburgh, PA) and I was given a free sample at a Right By Nature store.  Its ingredients were very similar to Progreens, as was the care they take with them, but their product mixed a bit better and has some stevia added so that it tasted pretty decent with just plain water.  It was called Go4Greens, and I don't see them selling it on amazon or ebay, but if you google it you'll find their website.  I would've never known they existed had we not stumbled on that free sample table (the person with me also agreed that their product mixed better and tasted better than what she was trying currently as well--- vitamineral green).","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2010","David J.

No such problem with this toner. I have combination skin that tends to be dryer in the winter, and it doesn't help that Texas is so windy and dusty. This is the first toner I have ever used, but it seems to be everything I could want in a toner. My lotion is finally penetrating my skin instead of floating on top or drying up, the ingredients aren't toxic and the price is right. I also recently began using Earth Science'a a-d-e cleanser on my face instead of  Dr Bronner's miracle soap, and that is also helping me combat my mild winter dryness. I still use Dr. Bronner's as my 'everything else' soap.

Best product I've ever accidentally bought.  I have very fair skin and burn every summer, despite my efforts with sunscreen, and have used dozens of brands of aloe, but this is hands down the best I've ever used.  No matter how burned I am, if I apply this within a few hours of being in the sun, I never have the pain often associated with a sunburn.  Even the most severe burns I've had are gone within a few days of regular application.  It absorbs quickly and doesn't leave that awful stickiness the green stuff does.  Even a small amount goes a long way and one tube will last me years (even though there's an expiration date, I haven't found that the effectiveness diminishes at all over time).I'll never buy any other aloe.

Someone commented the company should post the ingredients so I have my tube sitting here with me and I'll list them:Certified organic aloe vera barbadensis juice (gel), lactobacillus/arundinaria gigantea extract (bamboo), glucose (preservative), carbomer (thickener), aloe barbadensis leaf polysaccharides (certified organic aloesorb), tocopheryl acetate (vitamin e), retinyl palmitate (vitamin a), ascorbic acid (vitamin c), phenoxyethanol (preservative), glucose oxidase (and) lactoperoxidase (preservative), sodium hydroxide (ph adjuster)Isn't phenoxyethanol alcohol??

It's helped me get completely off of sugar. This stuff is totally natural, the Japanese have been using it for centuries; I don't understand why the FDA discourages promotion of it as a sweetener, because it's super-sweet (perhaps because companies producing poisons like aspartame would suffer huge losses).This is a particularly good brand, and since it's unflavored you can use it in anything -- especially good with yogurt or any kind of liquid. Not as good for baking though; for that try agave nectar. This brand has a higher concentration of stevia and does not use alcohol for filler like some other brands.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2007","Amazon Customer","Natural Sweet Leaf Sweet Drops have zero calories, zero carbs and are gluten-free.

This seems to really work to clear the lungs of mucus, and it even has the added bonus of seeming to clear the sinuses too, though it does not advertise as such. It is a good all round mucus eliminator!

A lovely sight for sure!  I use this aloe very gel in the morning, evening and during the night so 2 or 3 times a day and it controls the swelling, redness, peeling, burning and itching quite well.  It's not perfect but it makes this issue very manageable.I've been to the dermatologists and ophthalmologists and tried antibiotics etc to no avail.  So I began using natural products and this seems to work the best.Aloe vera is also very good for bad sunburns.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2014","ann PGA","Effective relief from: Sunburns, minor cuts, and burns, bites, chaffing, cold sores, rash and skin irritations.","Sold Individually

So if you find yourself needing to just overeat a snack, this is absolutely the way to go.All three of the women in our gluten-free household LOVE these crackers. We've ordered many more boxes.I have no idea why there are so many negative reviews. These crackers are small, that's true, but so what? We eat them straight and are not trying to top them with anything.My daughter who is the only one who remembers what Cheez-its taste like says the taste is similar but better.
